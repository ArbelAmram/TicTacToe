# TicTacToe
X/O Game (Three In A Line)

A Java game (Player vs CPU), where you try to complete three X's in a line,
and the CPU will try to complete three O's in a line.
You can try vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
It's your decision who will play the first turn.

The Challenge:
I dare you to let the CPU play the first turn, and still win, 
at best you will accomplish a tie.
